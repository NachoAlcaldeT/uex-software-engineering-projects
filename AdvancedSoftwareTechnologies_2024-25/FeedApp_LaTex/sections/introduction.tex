\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

In this project, we explore a variety of software development technologies by developing a prototype application, \textbf{FeedApp}. Our aim is to gain hands-on experience with modern technologies and evaluate their effectiveness in creating a scalable, secure, and maintainable software solution. \textbf{FeedApp} serves as a testbed for understanding the strengths and trade-offs of different tools and frameworks, allowing us to conduct a comparative analysis based on real implementation outcomes.

\textbf{FeedApp} is structured to manage users, polls, and votes through a REST API, incorporating essential features such as authentication, persistent storage, and real-time messaging. These components not only fulfill the application's functional requirements but also facilitate a comprehensive assessment of each technology's role and efficiency.

In this report, we document our design decisions, technology choices, and their impact on the development process. Additionally, we introduce a "featured technology" that enhances the system, allowing for a deeper analysis of its integration and performance within the \textbf{FeedApp} ecosystem. This report, therefore, serves as both a record of our prototype's implementation and an evaluation of the technologies applied, highlighting the insights and lessons we gained as a team.
